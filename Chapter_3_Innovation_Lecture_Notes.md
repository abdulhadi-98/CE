## III. THE PURPOSE AND FOUNDATIONS OF INNOVATION

### A. The Strategic Purpose of Innovation

**1. Economic Imperative**
- **Industrial Evolution Theory**: Links entrepreneurship directly to economic growth (Audretsch, 1995; Schumpeter, 1996)
- Innovation as the mechanism for:
  - Market entry
  - Organizational growth and survival
  - Industry transformation
  - National competitive advantage (Porter, 1990)

**Key Quote:** *"Invention and entrepreneurship are at the heart of national advantage"* - Michael Porter (1990)

**2. Beyond Economic Benefits: The Triple Bottom Line**

Innovation increasingly addresses:
- **Economic value**: Traditional profit and competitive advantage
- **Social value**: Improved well-being, equity, and access
- **Environmental value**: Sustainability and regenerative design

**Contemporary Example: Caterpillar's Regenerative Innovation**
- Recovered and remanufactured key components
- Result: 50% profit increase on product lines
- Simultaneously: 90% reduction in energy and water usage
- Demonstrates convergence of economic and environmental innovation

**3. The Circular Economy Paradigm** (Raworth, 2017)

New definition of economic well-being:
- Makes greater use of naturally renewable materials
- Emphasizes repair, reuse, refurbishment, and recycling
- Recaptures value at each stage of product decomposition
- "The business of business is to contribute to a thriving world"

**4. The Role of Public vs. Private Sector Innovation**

**Critical Debate: Who Drives Innovation?**

*Public Sector Contributions:*
- Funds early-stage (highest risk) basic research
- Historical examples: Mass production systems, nuclear power, aviation, internet, GPS
- US Government R&D (2008): 26% of total, with 57% going to basic research
- Rationale: Private sector reluctant to fund research without clear commercialization path

*Private Sector Contributions:*
- Focuses on later-stage development and commercialization
- US Private Sector R&D (2008): 67% of total, but only 18% to basic research
- Often benefits from publicly-funded research
- Example: Apple's iPhone leverages government investments in internet, GPS, touch-screen, and communication technologies

**Mazzucato's Argument (2018):**
- The State funds/undertakes much early-stage innovation
- Big pharmaceuticals particularly poor at basic research
- Private sector "buys in" research from biotech firms or public labs
- Focus on development and roll-out stages

**Janeway's "Three-Player Game" (2018):**
1. **State**: Invests in fundamental research
2. **Financial Sector**: Funds construction of transformational infrastructure
3. **Private Sector**: Commercializes opportunities, but tends toward monopoly exploitation rather than continued innovation

**Critical Implication:** Innovation is inherently unstable, characterized by "bubbles and crashes in the financial system" that nonetheless mobilize capital for high-risk ventures.

---

## IV. DEFINING AND MEASURING INNOVATION

### A. The Challenge of Definition

**Fundamental Concept:** Innovation = "New ways of doing something"

**Kanter's Definition (1983):**
"The generation, acceptance and implementation of new ideas, processes, products and services... [which] involves creative use as well as original invention"

**Schumpeter's Five Types of Innovation (1996):**
1. Introduction of new or improved good/service
2. Introduction of new process
3. Opening up of new market
4. Identification of new sources of supply
5. Creation of new types of industrial organization

**Proctor's Narrow Definition (2014):**
"Practical application of new inventions into marketable products and services"
- *Limitation:* Excludes last three Schumpeter types
- *Critique:* Too restrictive for comprehensive innovation strategy

### B. Three-Dimensional Innovation Framework

**Figure 3.1 Concept: Innovation measured on three continua:**

**1. PRODUCT/SERVICE INNOVATION**
- **Definition:** Completely new product/service OR improvements in design/functional qualities
- **Radical Example:** The Internet (created entirely new industries)
- **Incremental Example:** Anti-lock brakes for cars
- **Strategic Consideration:** Requires intellectual property (IP) protection, especially for radical innovations
- **Challenge:** High up-front R&D investment must be justified through sufficient income generation

**2. PROCESS INNOVATION**
- **Definition:** Revisions to how products/services are produced for better quality or lower cost
- **Radical Example:** Robot assembly lines
- **Incremental Example:** Merging two assembly elements
- **Strategic Advantage:** Can make products difficult for competitors to copy
- **Application:** Material substitution, production method improvements

**3. MARKETING INNOVATION**
- **Definition:** Improvements in marketing, distribution, or support of existing products/services
- **Radical Example:** Direct-to-consumer sales via telephone/internet
- **Incremental Example:** Guerrilla marketing, social media marketing
- **Characteristics:**
  - Often cheaper than product/process innovation
  - More easily copied by competitors
  - Becomes more critical later in product life-cycle

**4. BUSINESS MODEL INNOVATION** (Integrative)
- **Definition:** Developing distinctively different business models encompassing:
  - How business competes
  - Resource utilization
  - Relationship structures
  - Customer communication
  - Value creation
  - Profit generation

**Breakthrough Example: iTunes**
- Linked iPod technology to business model
- Monetized recorded music during CD sales decline and piracy era
- Revolutionary impact on music industry

**5. ARCHITECTURAL INNOVATION**
- **Definition:** Innovation in organizational configuration/structure
- **Strategic Advantage:** Most difficult for competitors to copy → most sustainable
- **Impact:** Makes organization more entrepreneurial and competitive

### C. The Measurement Challenge

**Key Problem:** No quantifiable scale for measuring innovation exists

**Economist's Perspective:**
- For product to be radically different: Cross elasticity of demand = 0
- Changes in demand for new product don't affect demand for existing products
- Most "new" products fail this test

**Example: The Mini Cooper**
- Innovative because it changed:
  - How cars were designed
  - Consumer perception of vehicle size
- **Lesson:** *Perception can be as important as objective reality*

**Academic Research Challenges:**
1. Defining what constitutes "newness"
2. Distinguishing incremental from radical
3. Multiple, often contradictory definitions across literature
4. Industry-specific variations in innovation patterns

---

## V. RADICAL PRODUCT/SERVICE INNOVATION

### A. Characteristics of Radical Innovation

**Definition:** "Mould-breaking" development of "new-to-the-world" products/processes

**Disruptive Potential:**
- Changes markets
- Transforms industries
- Reshapes societies

**Historical Examples by Century:**
- **18th Century:** Water power, textiles, iron
- **19th Century:** Steam, steel, rail
- **Early 20th Century:** Electricity, chemicals, internal combustion engine
- **Current Era:** Computers, mobile technologies, internet, cloud services

**Contemporary Disruptions:**
- **Google's Driverless Car:** Threatens automotive industry
- **Amazon Fresh:** Threatens fresh-food retail industry
- **Internet/Cloud Services:** Lowers barriers to entry across multiple industries
  - Facilitates market entry
  - Offers automation and economies of scale
  - Reduces capital costs

**Next Wave Predictions:**
- Artificial Intelligence
- Nanotechnology
- *Challenge:* Precise innovations difficult to predict
- *Opportunity:* Basic research largely funded by governments; private sector can now exploit

### B. Invention vs. Innovation: Critical Distinctions

**INVENTION:**
- Often linked with new technologies
- Product of research
- May spin off from other developments

**Classic Example: The Internet/World Wide Web**
- Inventor: Tim Berners-Lee
- Origin: US Defense Department network project at CERN
- Outcome: Berners-Lee did not directly benefit financially
- Lesson: Others (internet entrepreneurs) created businesses and fortunes from his invention

**Case Studies in Unsuccessful Inventors:**

1. **Charles Babbage** (English scientist)
   - Outlined principles of mechanical analytical engine (computer forerunner)
   - Had punch card programming, memory (store), processor (calculating engine)
   - Failed because: Forever tinkering with design, couldn't secure funding
   - Never commercialized invention

2. **Thomas Edison** (Prolific inventor)
   - Most successful inventor of all time
   - Paradox: Incompetent at market introduction
   - Backers had to remove him from every new business he founded
   - Lesson: Invention ≠ Business success

**CRITICAL INSIGHT:** Invention must be linked to successful commercialization to qualify as innovation

### C. The Challenge of Radical Innovation

**Market Research Limitations:**
- Potential customers have no experience with radically new products
- Cannot articulate needs for products they can't envision
- Traditional market research ill-suited for radical innovation prediction (Deszca et al., 1999)

**Organizational Barriers:**
- Large companies with sunk costs in established technologies
- Unwilling to exploit radical innovations even from external sources
- Example: Fossil fuel producers vs. sustainable energy
- Dominant in current markets but miss disruption opportunities

### D. Organizational Ambidexterity

**Definition:** Ability to simultaneously:
- **Explore:** Pursue new innovations
- **Exploit:** Commercialize existing innovations

**Origin:** Duncan (1976), popularized by March (1991)

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Appropriate organizational structure
- Supportive culture
- Effective leadership
- Entrepreneurial architecture

**Challenge:** Rare capability - most organizations struggle with balance

**Typical Pattern:**
- Large firms focus on exploitation (existing products/markets)
- Entrepreneurs pursue exploration (radical innovations)

### E. The Entrepreneur's Role in Innovation

**Henry Ford Example:**
- Did NOT invent the car
- Revolutionized production: Craft-based → Assembly line
- Revolutionized sales: Bespoke orders → Dealership model, affordable mass-market cars
- **Lesson:** Process and marketing innovation as valuable as invention

**Steve Jobs Example (Case Insight 1.4):**
- Never invented anything
- Applied others' technologies to revolutionize three industries:
  1. Personal computers (Apple)
  2. Music (iPod/iTunes)
  3. Film animation (Pixar)

**Jobs' Approach:**
- Launched Apple PC when IBM market research said no viable market
- Foresaw applications others couldn't envision
- Never trusted market research or focus groups
- Relied on entrepreneurial insight and instinct

**Critical Skill: Synthesis vs. Analysis** (Phadke & Vyakarnam, 2017)
- Entrepreneurs excel at synthesis: Linking technologies to market opportunities
- Makes technology more usable and attractive to consumers
- Conflicts with scientific tradition that values analysis
- **Key to commercialization:** Synthesis skill

## VI. BUSINESS MODEL INNOVATION AND MARKET PARADIGM SHIFT

### A. Defining Business Model Innovation

**Comprehensive Definition:**
Developing innovative plans for:
- How business competes
- Resource utilization
- Relationship structures
- Customer communication approaches
- Value creation mechanisms
- Profit generation methods

**Range:** Incremental → Radical
**Most Powerful Form:** Radical business model innovation creating market paradigm shift

### B. Market Paradigm Shift: Impact and Potential

**Definition:** Changes in established market conventions associated with creating radically new markets

**Kim & Mauborgne Study (2005):** 108 companies analyzed
- Only 14% of innovations created new markets (paradigm shift)
- BUT these innovations delivered:
  - **38%** of new revenues
  - **61%** of increased profits

**Implication:** Highest return-on-innovation comes from market paradigm shifts

### C. CASE STUDY: Low-Cost Airlines Revolution

**Traditional Airline Model (Pre-Disruption):**
- **Exemplars:** British Airways, Pan American
- **Target Market:** Business travelers and wealthy individuals
- **Value Proposition:** Premium service
- **Dominant Logic:** Air travel is luxury service for elite customers
- **Belief:** Cost structure prevents democratization of air travel

**Low-Cost Airline Innovation:**
- **Pioneers:** Southwest (USA), easyJet (UK), Ryanair (Ireland)

**Business Model Changes:**

1. **Product Strategy:**
   - Basic product unchanged: Safe point-to-point air travel
   - Service pared to minimum or charged as extras:
     - No seat allocation
     - No complimentary food/drink
     - Lower baggage allowances

2. **Operational Re-engineering:**
   - Fewer cabin crew
   - Longer pilot air-time
   - Fast airport turnaround
   - Single aircraft type (maintenance efficiency)
   - Secondary airports (lower fees)

3. **Marketing Innovation:**
   - Aggressive promotion
   - Differential pricing (early booking discounts)
   - Virtual ticketing
   - Load factor maximization

**Outcome:**
- **New Market Created:** Air travel for ordinary people
- **Paradigm Shift:** From luxury to utility
- **Industry Impact:** Many flagship carriers went out of business
- **Revenue Model:** High volume, low margin vs. low volume, high margin

**Strategic Lesson:** Challenged what customers valued; created value through different model

### D. Sources of Paradigm Shift Opportunities

**Technology-Driven:**
- Internet enabling new distribution models
- Mobile technologies creating new service possibilities

**Market-Driven:**
- Emergence of untapped markets with different value expectations
- Changes in environmental conditions

**Regulatory-Driven:**
- New legal requirements creating opportunities

**Value Reconfiguration:**
- Doing things differently that ADD value without extra costs
- Doing things differently that REDUCE costs while maintaining price
- Deriving revenues from alternative sources (e.g., advertising, data sales)

**Example: "Free" Internet Services**
- Free services to customers
- Revenue from selling customer data to advertisers
- Value exchange: Service for data

### E. Challenging Dominant Logic

**Industry Paradigms:**
- Factors managers believe critical to business success
- Endure over long periods
- Become part of industry's dominant logic
- Filter information managers receive
- Constrain thinking based on prior knowledge (Venkataraman, 1997)

**The Disruption Pattern (Christensen, 1997):**

**Stable Market Characteristics:**
- Companies gear up to deliver more of what existing customers want
- Don't want to disrupt dominant market position
- Heavy R&D investment in existing product lines
- Strong supply chain links
- Close customer relationships
- Continuous stream of incremental innovations

**The Failure Pattern:**
- With each generation, previously successful large firms failed to transition
- Often squeezed out or bankrupted
- Despite being exemplars of good practice
- **Root Cause:** Inability to identify and capitalize on emerging markets with different needs/expectations

**Why Good Companies Fail:**
1. Too close to existing customers
2. Technologies drive products rather than market needs
3. Miss long-term potential of fringe businesses
4. Simpler/cheaper alternatives move mainstream
5. By the time they realize, competitive advantage lost

### F. Tools for Creating Paradigm Shifts

**1. Chaston's Systematic Approach (2015):**
- Challenge market conventions systematically
- Develop new solutions
- Create different models more attractive to customers
- Lower cost and risk than radical product innovation

**2. Kim & Mauborgne's Blue Ocean Strategy (2005):**
- Find unrecognized, unmet market needs
- Create uncontested market space
- Make competition irrelevant
- **Approach:** Challenge established status quo/dominant logic

**3. Service-Dominant Logic (Vargo & Lusch, 2004):**

**Core Premise:** Customers purchase services, not goods
- Goods are medium for delivering/transmitting services

**Definition of Service:**
"Application of specialized competences (knowledge and skills) through deeds, processes, and performances for the benefit of another entity"

**Transformative Examples:**
- Car manufacturers → Mobility service providers
- Aero-engine manufacturers → Power-by-the-hour service providers

**Strategic Implications:**
- All industries are service industries
- Shift focus from product to consumer
- Understand service consumers seek and will pay for
- Fundamentally different way of viewing business models

### G. COMPREHENSIVE CASE STUDY: Rolls-Royce TotalCare®

**Traditional Model:**
- Sell jet engines (product)
- Sell separate service package
- Customer owns engine
- Time and materials pricing for service

**TotalCare® Innovation:**

**New Business Model:**
- Fee per engine running hour (service, not product)
- Customers pay for power as used
- Rolls-Royce monitors engine sensors
- Guarantees engine availability
- Arranges all service/parts replacement

**Value Proposition Transformation:**
- From fixed cost investment → Variable cost service
- Airlines reduce capital requirements
- Rolls-Royce locks in customers and parts business
- Win-win outcome

**Environmental Benefits:**
- Incentive to minimize lifetime costs, not initial cost
- Higher quality to minimize service/repair time
- Engines remain Rolls-Royce property → design for:
  - Maximum reuse potential
  - End-of-life recycling
- Aligns economic and environmental objectives

**Business Impact:**
- Most of Rolls-Royce income now from TotalCare® service
- Changed from product to service company
- Business model now dominates industry
- Facilitated growth of low-cost airlines

**Strategic Lessons:**
1. Product/service innovation enables business model innovation
2. Business model innovation can be more valuable than product innovation
3. Service-dominant logic transforms value proposition
4. Environmental benefits can align with economic benefits
5. Lock-in effects create sustainable competitive advantage

### CASE STUDY 2: Bill Gates and Microsoft - Missing the Internet

**Context:** Microsoft's failure to capitalize on internet despite early recognition

**1995 Internal Memo (Bill Gates):**
*"Developments on the internet over the next several years will set the course of our industry for a long time to come... I assign the internet the highest level of importance... our focus on the internet is crucial to every part of our business. The internet is the most important single development to come along since the IBM PC was introduced in 1981."*

**The Paradox:**
- Clear recognition of internet importance
- Gates himself identified the opportunity
- Company failed to act on this knowledge

**By 2014:**
- Windows and Microsoft Office sales falling sharply
- Forced to announce "far-reaching realignment"
- Disbanded product groups
- Made redundancies
- Reorganized into functional lines (engineering, marketing, strategy, research)
- Playing "catch up" with tech giants

**Root Cause Analysis:**

**Dominant Logic Problem:**
- Main revenue: Windows Operating System + Microsoft Office
- Extremely profitable existing products
- Resources targeted at DEFENDING existing dominance
- New developments that could cannibalize main revenue suppressed
- Exploitation focus, not exploration focus

**What Microsoft Missed:**
- Could have dominated search engine market (vs. Google)
- Had dominant position and enormous resources
- Innovation threats to existing products not allowed to surface

**Lessons Learned:**

1. **Recognition ≠ Action:** Knowing about opportunity doesn't guarantee pursuit
2. **Dominant Logic Trap:** Success with existing products blinds to new opportunities
3. **Cannibalization Fear:** Protecting current revenue streams prevents innovation
4. **Organizational Inertia:** Large, successful organizations struggle to change direction
5. **Exploitation vs. Exploration:** Need ambidexterity to succeed long-term

**Discussion Questions:**
1. How difficult is it to break from organizational dominant logic?
2. How difficult is it to "predict" the future in business?
3. What organizational structures prevent dominant logic traps?

**Contemporary Relevance:**
- Pattern repeats across industries
- Kodak and digital photography
- Blockbuster and streaming
- Taxi companies and ride-sharing

### CASE STUDY 3: Swatch - Market Paradigm Shift Through Design

**Industry Context (1980s):**

3. **Marketing Innovation:**
   - Changed purchase motivation: Need (tell time) → Desire (fashion)
   - Encouraged repeat purchases (multiple fashion accessories)
   - New designs every year
   - Built loyal customer core

**Outcomes:**
- Created entirely new market
- Made watches collectible fashion items
- Changed "why" people buy watches
- Affordable price point enabled multiple purchases

**Strategic Lessons:**

1. **Paradigm Challenge:** Question basic assumptions about product purpose
2. **Design as Strategy:** Design can be primary differentiator
3. **Emotional Value:** Functional + emotional appeal more powerful than functional alone
4. **Business Model Shift:** From one-time purchase to repeat purchase behavior
5. **Affordable Luxury:** Premium positioning at accessible price point

**Discussion Questions:**
1. How difficult is it to change how you think about a product/market?

## IX. INNOVATION INTENSITY

### A. Conceptual Framework

**Definition:** An increase in both the degree (or scale) AND frequency of innovation within an organization

**From Figure 2.1:** Entrepreneurial intensity = Frequency × Scale of entrepreneurial outputs

**Applied to Innovation:** Innovation intensity reflects entrepreneurial architecture outcomes

### B. The Reality of Innovation

**Key Findings:**

1. **Incremental Dominance:**
   - Few companies achieve "breakthrough" innovations (Wagner et al., 2014)
   - Even fewer achieve radical innovations
   - Majority of commercially significant innovations are incremental (Audretsch, 1995)
   - Most successful innovations are improvements, not inventions

2. **Success Through Improvement:**
   - **Apple:** Good design + ease of use, not invention
     - Apple I: Improved interface (GUI + mouse)
     - iPod: Improved MP3 players (existed for years)
     - iPhone: Improved Nokia/Blackberry phones
   
   - **Google:** Entered crowded search market (AltaVista dominated)
     - Created better product (improved search algorithm)
     - Commercial success: AdWords system (invented by Idealab)
   
   - **Facebook:** Entered after Friendster, MySpace
     - Better execution, not first mover

**Lesson:** *Success comes from doing existing things better, not always from invention*

### C. Two-Dimensional Innovation Intensity Model (Figure 3.2a)

**Axes:**
1. **Vertical:** Degree/Scale of Innovation (Low/Incremental → High/Radical)
2. **Horizontal:** Frequency of Innovation (Low/Infrequent → High/Frequent)

**Strategic Goal:** Push innovation envelope as far as possible in both dimensions

**Arshi & Burns Study (2018):**
- Found entrepreneurial architecture associated with innovation intensity
- Each form of innovation independent of others
- Architecture antecedent to intensity

### D. Three-Dimensional Model (Figure 3.2b)

**Added Third Dimension:** Speed of Innovation

**Rationale:**
- First-mover advantage
- Competitive timing
- Market window opportunities

**Strategic Consideration:** Speed to market as competitive weapon

### E. Multiple Innovation Paths Strategy

**Key Principle:** Incremental and radical innovations NOT mutually exclusive

**Benefits of Simultaneous Pursuit:**

1. **Risk Distribution:**
   - Incremental: Lower risk, more frequent returns
   - Radical: Higher risk, potentially transformative returns
   - Portfolio approach balances risk

2. **Cumulative Impact:**
   - Many small incremental innovations → enormous competitive advantage (Bessant, 1999)
   - Can add up to revolution

3. **Building Blocks:**
   - Track record of successful incremental innovation
   - Prerequisite for radical innovation (Dunlop-Hinkler et al., 2010)
   - Develops organizational innovation capability

### F. Henry Ford Example: Revolution Through Incremental Changes

**Changes Implemented:**
- Product design improvements
- Process innovations (assembly line)
- Component design changes
- Factory design innovations
- Labor organization methods
- Marketing innovation (dealership model)

**Result:** Revolutionary impact on car industry through accumulated incremental innovations

**Strategic Lesson:** Revolution doesn't require single radical breakthrough; can result from systematic incremental changes

### G. Implications for Entrepreneurial Architecture

**Design Objectives:**
1. Encourage ALL forms of innovation:
   - Product, process, marketing
   - Incremental AND radical

2. Create systems supporting:
   - Frequent innovation (regularity)
   - Significant innovation (scale)
   - Fast innovation (speed)

3. Balance portfolio:
   - Quick wins (incremental)
   - Transformative bets (radical)
   - Continuous improvement culture

## X. INNOVATION AND RISK

### A. The Risk Paradox

**BCG Survey Finding (2018):** Risk-averse culture = major barrier to innovation

**Contemporary Reality:**
- Innovation is risky
- BUT not innovating is RISKIER in today's competitive environment

**Implication:** Must develop capability to manage innovation risk, not avoid it

### B. Risk Hierarchy by Innovation Type

**LOWEST RISK: Incremental Product/Service Innovation**

**Characteristics:**
- Builds on established knowledge
- Leverages existing product/service
- Years of experience
- Established marketing channels
- Known resource capabilities

**Risk Factors:**
- Distance from core competences
- Further from core = Higher risk

**Organizational Advantages:**
- Practice breeds competence
- Innovation capability itself reduces risk

**SPECIAL CASE: Brand Extension**

**Lowest Risk When:**
- Core competence in customer relationships
- Effective branding
- Synergy through economies of scope

**Example: Virgin Group**
- Successfully extended brand across diverse products/services:
  - Train transport
  - Airplane transport
  - Broadband
  - Financial services
- Brand trust transfers across categories

**HIGHER RISK: New Market Entry**

**Risk Increases When:**
- Pushing into new, unfamiliar markets
- Even with existing products

**Lowest Risk Organizations:**
- Strong sales and marketing capabilities
- OR efficient production methods with scale economies
- Capital goods/extractive industries

**HIGHEST RISK: Radical Innovation + New Markets**

**Figure 3.3 Framework:**

**Axes:**
1. **Vertical:** Degree/Scale of Product/Service Innovation (Low/Incremental → High/Radical)
2. **Horizontal:** Newness of Market/Unfamiliarity (Low → High)

**Risk Diagonal:** Increases as move away from:
- Known products
- Known markets
- Core competences

**Four Quadrants:**

1. **Low Risk:** Incremental innovation + Existing markets
   - Known customer needs
   - Existing competences
   - Straightforward execution

2. **Medium Risk:** Incremental innovation + New markets
   - OR Radical innovation + Existing markets
   - One dimension of uncertainty

3. **High Risk:** Radical innovation + New markets
   - Many unknowns
   - Multiple dimensions of uncertainty
   - Furthest from core competences

### C. Timing and Diffusion Risk

**S-Curve of Innovation Diffusion (See Chapter 14):**

**Pace of Diffusion:**
- Unpredictable
- Likely slower for radical innovations
- Market education required

**Slow Diffusion Risks:**
- Capital tied up longer
- Competitors can catch up
- Market may not materialize

**Rapid Diffusion Risks:**
- Capacity constraints
- Quality issues from rushing
- Unable to capitalize on first-mover advantage

**Launch Timing Risks:**
- **Too Early:** Ahead of market readiness, educate competitors
- **Too Late:** Lose first-mover advantage, face many competitors

### D. Contemporary Challenge: Simultaneous Multi-dimensional Innovation

**Today's Environment:**
- Rapid technological change
- Global markets
- Increasing interlinkages

**Forced Innovation Pattern:**
- Geographic expansion + Technological change simultaneously
- Innovating while entering new markets
- Highest risk scenario

**Example: US Internet Giants Convergence**

**Original Offerings:**
- Amazon: Internet retailer
- Apple: Computers
- Facebook: Social network
- Google: Internet search
- Microsoft: Software

**Current Strategy:**
- All converging to offer similar products/services
- Fighting for monopoly position as digital utility
- Best online platform for all customer digital requirements

**Competitive Dynamic:**
- More services → More customers → More data
- Own branded hardware with wired-in services
- Network effects create "winner-take-most" markets
- Staggering profits for winners

### E. Managing Innovation Risk

**Key Risk Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Information and Knowledge:**
   - Understand products/services being innovated
   - Understand markets being entered
   - Continuous learning

2. **Cognitive Heuristics:**
   - Organization-wide risk assessment frameworks
   - Information flows
   - Decision-making protocols

3. **External Sourcing:**
   - Buy-in knowledge through consultants
   - Recruit specialized staff
   - Partner with established firms in target markets
   - Acquire firms with market presence

4. **Technology Acquisition:**
   - Buy-in new technologies
   - License innovations
   - Open-source innovation

5. **Network Relationships:**
   - Leverage partnerships
   - Industry associations
   - Academic collaborations

**Entrepreneurial Architecture Role:**
- Facilitate information flows
- Enable knowledge acquisition
- Support partnership formation
- Create learning organization

**Later chapters demonstrate:** Risk management as integral part of entrepreneurial architecture

## XI. INNOVATION, PROFITABILITY, AND GROWTH

### A. The Complex Relationship

**Expected Relationships:**
1. Higher innovation intensity → Higher profits (risk-return relationship)
2. High-growth firms → More innovative (growth driver)

**Reality:** Linkages not straightforward; finding direct relationships problematic

### B. Why Evidence is Inconclusive

**METHODOLOGICAL CHALLENGES:**

**1. Measurement Problem:**

**Common Proxy: R&D Spend**
- No guarantee of successful innovation
- Without success = Extra expenditure depressing profits
- What's needed:
  - Effective architecture focusing research
  - Complementary assets facilitating commercialization (Freel & Robson, 2004)

**Better Measures:**
- Actual innovation outputs
- New product sales
- Process improvements
- Market share gains

**2. Lagged Effects:**

**Positive Finding:** Innovation positively associated with employment growth (Cosh & Hughes, 2007)

**Profit Growth Challenges:**
- Link with profits likely "lagged"
- Innovation takes time (perhaps years) to feed into profit growth
- More radical innovation = Longer lag
- Timing of measurement critical

**3. Cycling Phenomenon (Cefis, 2003):**

**Pattern:**
- Firms innovate in one period
- Then "consolidate" in next period
- Understandable and rational

**Measurement Problem:**
- Improved performance may result from innovation
- But observed/measured in consolidation period
- Creates timing confusion in studies

**4. Causation vs. Correlation:**

**Critical Question:** Even if observable link exists, does it prove causation?

**Freel (2000) Caution:**
*"While small innovators may in aggregate grow faster than non-innovators, this is not to suggest that innovation is a necessary, nor less a sufficient condition for growth or superior performance"*

**Alternative Explanations:**
- Both innovation and growth driven by third factor (e.g., management quality)
- Reverse causation: Profitability enables innovation investment
- Selection bias: Only successful innovators survive to be measured

### C. What Empirical Evidence Shows

**POSITIVE FINDINGS:**

**1. Risk-Taking and Returns (McGrath, 2001):**
- Firms following "conventional paths": Lower financial returns
- Firms taking risks: Variable outcomes (medium to high returns)
- Risk-takers: Greater long-term profitability potential

**2. Entrepreneurial Risk-Taking (Dess et al., 2011; Tang et al., 2014):**
- Positively influences financial performance
- Positively influences business growth

**3. Radical Innovation Impact (Atuahene-Gima, 2005; Tellis & Golder, 2002):**
- Leads to market domination
- Drives firm growth

**4. Innovation-Growth Link:**
- Some empirical support (Geroski & Machin, 1992; Yasuda, 2005)

**NEGATIVE/INCONCLUSIVE FINDINGS:**

**No Direct General Relationship Found:**
- Coad & Rao (2008)
- Lööf & Hesshmati (2006)
- O'Regan et al. (2006)

### D. Academic Conclusion

**Conservative Assessment:**
- Evidence linking innovation with financial performance: Intuitively likely
- But empirically: **INCONCLUSIVE**

**Implications for Practice:**
- Don't innovate solely for proven financial returns
- Consider strategic, competitive, and survival imperatives
- View innovation as necessary for long-term viability
- Manage innovation portfolio for balance and timing

**Research Opportunity:**
- Better measurement methodologies needed
- Longitudinal studies capturing lag effects
- Control for cycling and consolidation
- Isolate causation from correlation

## XII. INNOVATION, COMPANY SIZE, AND INDUSTRY STRUCTURE

### A. The Size Paradox

**Apparent Contradiction:** Studies show both:
- Large firms more likely to be innovative
- Small firms more innovative per employee

### B. Large Firm Innovation Advantages

**EU DATA (2007):**
- Larger firms (250+ employees) MORE LIKELY to be innovative
- Than smaller firms (10-49 employees)

**UK DATA (Robson & Haigh, 2008):**

**Large Firms (250+ employees) MORE LIKELY to:**
- Conduct internal R&D
- Contract out R&D
- Introduce product innovations
- Introduce process innovations
- Introduce managerial innovations

**SAME STUDY - CONTRADICTORY FINDING:**
- **Small firms:** Higher percentage of turnover from disruptive innovations
- New-to-market or new-to-business products
- Greater proportion of revenue from radical innovation

### C. Small Firm Innovation Advantages

**Innovation Efficiency:**
- US Study (Acs & Audretsch, 1990): Small firms produce **2.4 times as many innovations per employee** as large firms

**Measurement Challenges:**
- Small firms often can't separate out R&D expenditure
- May not have designated R&D employees
- Innovation embedded in daily operations

**Process Advantages:**
- Conduct R&D more efficiently
- Introduce new products to marketplace faster
- More flexible and agile

**Patents as Measure:**
- Accurate but limited
- Vary widely across industry sectors
- May undercount small firm innovation (don't always patent)

### D. Industry Structure Effects

**STRONG FINDING:** Industry structure significantly influences innovation level (Santarelli & Piergiovanni, 1996)

**MATURE, HIGHLY CONCENTRATED INDUSTRIES:**
- Innovation LESS LIKELY
- Large firms dominant innovators
- Focus on incremental product innovations
- Cost-reducing process innovations

**NEW, LESS CONCENTRATED INDUSTRIES:**
- Innovation MORE LIKELY
- Small entrepreneurial firms more important
- Entrepreneurial architecture most advantageous
- Radical, disruptive innovations common

### E. Resource vs. Behavioral Advantages

**LARGE FIRM ADVANTAGES (Resources):**

1. **Capital:**
   - Better access to internal financing
   - Better access to external financing
   - Can fund large-scale R&D

2. **Scale:**
   - Economies of scale in R&D
   - Economies of scale in production
   - Economies of scale in advertising/marketing

3. **Productivity:**
   - Generally higher than small firms
   - Efficient processes
   - Established systems

**Where Large Firms Outperform:**
- Capital-intensive industries
- High R&D spend requirements
- Scale-dependent advantages
- Advertising-intensive sectors

**SMALL FIRM ADVANTAGES (Behavioral):**

1. **Market Closeness:**
   - Better understanding of customer needs
   - Faster response to market changes
   - Direct customer relationships

2. **Risk Tolerance:**
   - Greater willingness to take risks
   - Less to lose
   - Entrepreneurial mindset

3. **Speed:**
   - Ability to act quickly
   - Less bureaucracy
   - Faster decision-making

**Example: Amazon's Retail Disruption**
- Amazon R&D spend (2018): **$27 billion**
- GlaxoSmithKline (pharmaceutical multinational): ~$5.8 billion
- Question: How many retailers can compete at this R&D level?
- Online retail disrupting traditional retail
- Scale matters enormously in facing disruption

### F. Why Large Firms Underperform in Innovation

**Paradox:** Despite advantages (resources, funding, knowledge, experienced management), large firms often not main source of innovation

**Main Reason:** Too focused on existing products and established markets
- Makes direction change difficult
- Dominant logic constrains thinking
- Risk of cannibalizing existing revenue
- Organizational inertia

### G. Integrated Understanding: Not Just Size

**KEY INSIGHT:** Innovative behavior not entirely related to firm size

**PATTERN 1: Small Firm Advantages**
- Significant role in radical, disruptive innovation
- Spot opportunities from basic research
- Develop innovation quickly
- Move quickly to market
- **Large Firm Response:** Must develop entrepreneurial architecture and knowledge networks

**PATTERN 2: Large Firm Resource Advantage**
- Significant resource advantage
- More productive generally
- Lower resource costs
- **But:** Small firms use resources more EFFICIENTLY for innovation
- **Large Firm Opportunity:** Develop entrepreneurial architecture to match small firm efficiency with large firm resources

**PATTERN 3: Niche Markets**
- Small firms thrive where scale less important than:
  - Marketing
  - Service quality
  - Variety
- Often niche but highly profitable
- **Large Firm Strategy:**
  - Reorganize into smaller units
  - Entrepreneurial architecture for each unit
  - Develop different business models valued by niche markets
  - Leverage resources small competitors lack

**PATTERN 4: Mature Industries**
- Small entrepreneurial firms less important
- Stable, high-concentration industries
- Innovation focus: Efficiency and cost reduction
- **Implication:** Entrepreneurial architecture may be counter-productive
- **Strategic Response:** Radical innovation or sector diversification to prolong organizational life

### H. Collaboration as Strategy

**Key Observation (Vossen, 1998):**
- Advantages of large firms = Disadvantages of small firms (and vice versa)
- **Implication:** Collaboration creates powerful synergistic relationships

**Benefits of Small-Large Collaboration:**
- Small firm: Innovation, speed, market insight
- Large firm: Resources, scale, distribution
- Combined: Accelerated innovation with market impact

**Forms:**
- Partnerships
- Joint ventures
- Licensing agreements
- Acquisition (but maintain entrepreneurial culture)

**Theme:** Returns throughout book

## XIX. CRITICAL REFLECTION QUESTIONS FOR ADVANCED STUDENTS

1. **Mazzucato argues the State drives innovation, while others credit entrepreneurs. Who's right? Or is it a false dichotomy?**

2. **If market research fails for radical innovation, what decision-making processes should replace it?**

3. **How can organizations systematically overcome dominant logic without creating chaos?**

4. **Is the "ambidextrous organization" a realistic goal or an academic ideal?**

5. **Given inconclusive evidence linking innovation to profitability, should firms still prioritize it? Why?**

6. **How do you reconcile the need for speed with the need for careful risk assessment in innovation?**

7. **Can large firms truly develop entrepreneurial architecture, or does size inherently constrain innovation?**

8. **How might AI and automation change the relationship between innovation and employment growth?**

9. **What are the ethical implications of innovation that disrupts entire industries and displaces workers?**

10. **How should we measure innovation in the age of open source and collaborative development?**

---

## XX. CONCLUDING THOUGHTS

Innovation is simultaneously:
- **Essential** for organizational survival
- **Difficult** to define and measure
- **Risky** but manageable
- **Context-dependent** in its patterns
- **Systematic** in its encouragement
- **Complex** in its outcomes

**Core Message for Students:**

Success in innovation requires:
1. **Understanding** multiple dimensions and types
2. **Balancing** incremental and radical approaches
3. **Managing** risk through knowledge and architecture
4. **Adapting** to organizational size and industry context
5. **Connecting** diverse ideas and people
6. **Persisting** despite measurement and outcome uncertainties

**The Entrepreneurial Imperative:**

In today's environment, the question is not WHETHER to innovate, but HOW to innovate systematically, repeatedly, and effectively while managing associated risks.

The organizations that master this balance—through appropriate entrepreneurial architecture—will thrive. Those that don't, risk becoming case studies in disruption and decline.
