## 1. Introduction: The Purpose of Innovation

### 1.1 Innovation as the Heart of Entrepreneurship

Innovation is fundamentally about creating change and opportunity. According to theories of 'industrial evolution', entrepreneurship and economic growth are directly linked through innovation. Key purposes of innovation include:

- **Market Entry and Growth**: Innovation enables firms to enter new markets and grow existing market positions
- **Competitive Advantage**: Creating and sustaining competitive advantage through differentiation
- **Industry Transformation**: Occasionally, innovation creates entirely new industries
- **Economic Development**: As Michael Porter (1990) stated: "Invention and entrepreneurship are at the heart of national advantage"

### 1.2 Broader Impact of Innovation

Innovation extends beyond economic benefits to encompass:

**Environmental Well-being:**
- Example: Caterpillar increased profits by 50% while cutting energy and water usage by 90% through remanufacturing
- Circular economy concepts: repair, reuse, refurbish, and recycle
- Regenerative design moving from degenerative industrial practices

**Social Well-being:**
- Kate Raworth's concept: "The business of business is to contribute to a thriving world"
- New organizational structures (cooperatives, not-for-profits, community interest companies)
- Values-driven missions creating broader societal benefits

### 1.3 The Role of Public and Private Sectors

**Public Sector Innovation:**
- Government investment crucial for early-stage, high-risk innovation
- Development of general-purpose technologies (mass production, aviation, internet, space technologies)
- In 2008: 57% of US government R&D funding went to basic research

**Private Sector Innovation:**
- Better at commercialization and later-stage innovation
- In 2008: Only 18% of private sector R&D went to basic research
- Often builds upon public sector research (e.g., Apple's iPhone utilizing government-funded GPS, internet, touchscreen technologies)

**The Three-Player Game (Janeway, 2018):**
1. State investment in fundamental research
2. Financial speculation funding transformational infrastructure
3. Private sector exploitation raising living standards

---

## 2. Defining and Measuring Innovation

### 2.1 Defining Innovation

**Simple Definition:** "New ways of doing something"

**Kanter's Definition (1983):**
"The generation, acceptance and implementation of new ideas, processes, products and services... [which] involves creative use as well as original invention"

### 2.2 Schumpeter's Five Types of Innovation

1. **Introduction of new or improved goods/services**
2. **Introduction of new processes**
3. **Opening up of new markets**
4. **Identification of new sources of supply**
5. **Creation of new types of industrial organization**

### 2.3 Three Dimensions of Innovation

Innovation can be conceptualized across three interconnected dimensions, each ranging from incremental to radical:

#### A. Product/Service Innovation
- **Definition:** Completely new products/services or improvements in design and/or functional qualities
- **Radical Example:** The internet (created entire new industries)
- **Incremental Example:** Anti-lock brakes for cars
- **Protection:** Intellectual property rights crucial, especially for radical innovations with high R&D investment

#### B. Process Innovation
- **Definition:** Revisions to how products/services are produced for improved quality or reduced costs
- **Radical Example:** Robot assembly lines
- **Incremental Example:** Merging two assembly elements
- **Advantage:** Can make products/services difficult to copy

#### C. Marketing Innovation
- **Definition:** Improvements in marketing, distribution, or support of existing products/services
- **Radical Example:** Direct selling via telephone/internet
- **Incremental Example:** Guerrilla marketing, social media campaigns
- **Characteristics:** 
  - Often cheaper than other innovation forms
  - More easily copied by competitors
  - Must evolve with product life-cycle stages

### 2.4 The Challenge of Measuring Innovation

**Key Issues:**
- No quantifiable universal scale for innovation (Baregheh et al., 2009)
- Incremental vs. radical is a matter of judgment
- **Economic Perspective:** True innovation requires zero cross-elasticity of demand
  - Changes in demand for one product don't affect demand for another
  - Simply introducing similar products is not innovative

**Innovation vs. Invention:**
- **Invention:** Creating something new (may not be commercially successful)
- **Innovation:** Successfully commercializing an invention
- Many inventions fail commercially
- Many inventors don't benefit from their inventions
- Example: Tim Berners-Lee's World Wide Web invention vs. its commercial innovation

---

## 3. Business Model Innovation

### 3.1 Definition and Scope

**Business Model Innovation** involves developing distinctive plans for:
- How a business competes
- Resource utilization
- Relationship structuring
- Customer communication
- Value creation
- Profit generation

**Comprehensive Nature:**
- Can involve all three dimensions: product, process, and marketing innovation
- Example: iTunes revolutionized music business by linking iPod technology with a business model that monetized recorded music

### 3.2 Radical Business Model Innovation and Market Paradigm Shifts

**Characteristics:**
- Creates **market paradigm shift**: Changes how people think about products/services
- Challenges established market conventions
- Often more sustainable than other innovation types (harder to copy)

**Case Study: Low-Cost Airlines**

*Traditional Model:*
- High-cost structure
- Premium service
- Business travelers as primary target
- Established airlines ignored mass market

*Innovative Model:*
- Minimized operational costs
- Pared-back service (charges for extras)
- Targeted ordinary people
- Created entirely new market segment
- **Result:** New market for low-price air travel

### 3.3 Barriers to Innovation: The Microsoft Example

**Bill Gates' 1995 Internal Memo:**
- Recognized internet would "set the course of our industry for a long time"
- Acknowledged Microsoft was poorly positioned
- Highlighted challenge of established firms adapting to radical change
- Demonstrates even successful companies face innovation barriers

**Common Barriers:**
- Existing business model success
- Organizational inertia
- Fear of cannibalizing existing products
- Established market position creating complacency

---

## 4. Challenging Market Paradigms

### 4.1 Systematic Approach to Market Disruption

**Strategy:**
- Challenge market conventions underlying established business models

### 4.2 Service-Dominant Logic

**Core Concept (Vargo and Lusch, 2004):**
- Customers purchase services, not goods
- Goods are medium for delivering services
- Service = "application of specialized competences (knowledge and skills)"

**Implications:**
- Shifts focus from product features to customer value
- Enables new business model development
- Changes how companies think about offerings

### 4.3 Case Study: Swatch

**Market Context:**
- Traditional watch market: expensive, precision timepieces
- People typically owned one watch
- Swiss watchmaking reputation for quality and craftsmanship

**Innovation Strategy:**
- **Goal:** Make affordable fashion accessories that are accurate timepieces

**Framework:**
```
High/Radical ┃━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┃ Increasing Innovation
            ┃                      ┃ Intensity
            ┃                      ┃
Low/        ┃━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┃
Incremental     Low  →  High
                   Frequency
```

**Key Insight:**

## 8. Innovation, Profitability, and Growth

### 8.1 The Complex Relationship

**Research Challenges:**
- Difficult to establish clear causation
- Multiple confounding factors
- Measurement timing issues

### 8.2 Key Research Findings

**Positive Indicators:**
- Firms that innovate tend to grow faster
- Innovation linked to survival in competitive markets
- New industries show strong innovation-growth links

**Complicating Factors:**

1. **The "Cycling" Phenomenon (Cefis, 2003):**
   - Firms innovate in one period

   - Creates timing confusion in measurement

2. **Causation Questions:**
   - Correlation ≠ causation
   - "While small innovators may in aggregate grow faster than non-innovators, this does not prove causation"
   - May be that fast-growing firms can afford to innovate

3. **Survivor Bias:**
   - Unsuccessful innovations lead to firm failure
   - Only successful innovators remain in data
   - Skews observed relationships

### 8.3 Practical Implications

**For Organizations:**
- Innovation necessary but not sufficient for success
- Must be accompanied by effective execution
- Risk management crucial
- Learning from failures important

**For Research:**
